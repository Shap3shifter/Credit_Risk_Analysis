# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to determine which sampling model performs best in predicting the credit risk level of credit card applicants. We are using a dataset provided by LendingClub which provides all kinds of attributes on each credit card applicant and we will determine which model performs best based on the following attributes: 

- Balanced Accuracy Score - How accurately (in %age) does the model produce the proper credit risk assessment
- Precision Score - What percentage of the time the model correctly predicts that an applicant is a low-risk one when the applicant actually is a low-risk candidate versus predicting the applicant is low-risk while they're in fact a high-risk candidate.
- Recall Score - What percentage of the time the model correctly predicts that an applicant is a low-risk candidate while the applicant is a low-risk candidate versus predicting the applicant is high-risk while they're in fact a low-risk candidate.

## Results

#### Naive Random Oversampling

#### SMOTE Oversampling

#### ClusterCentroids Undersampling

#### SMOTEENN, a mix of over and undersampling
